Hi Leela - thank you for thinking of me.  

Congratulations and thank you for your volunteer work.  There is a big problem that needs to be solved and i”m working on it right now.  I don’t know if the solution is more technology or better communication or some combination.

The problem:  You hear a siren or you see smoke.  What should you do?

This happened just two days ago, so I have some real user data (me) and what I did personally.

1) Turn on my GMRS radio to the Cal Fire channel to see if I can figure out what’s up - no luck
2) Check email  to see if anyone has posted to South Skyline Yahoo Groups
3) Check Facebook to see if there’s any info on 3 different groups
4) Check email to see if there’s a buzz
4) Email Pat O’Coffey - ask what’s going on (she has HAM)
5) Call Peggy Wargo - she had the info

Peggy and Pat each sent me some websites where I could  monitor to figure out what’s up.

Turned out to be a house fire in La Honda, but a whole lot of people spent a lot of time trying to figure it out.

So - the need: 

A real-time communication system for mountain disasters.  Multiple ways of  information movement - pull and push.  One place that feeds many places?  Then… Communication of the communication system.

I am gathering a list of all the communications techniques and avenues currently being used.  Perhaps there is an existing approach that we just need to consistently use and publicize? One mountain challenge is an older demographic that doesn’t want to learn how to use “new stuff”  Twitter, etc.  Will need to do some training too.

I have family in town and will be more available mid July. Would be happy to meet with your group if this sounds interesting as a project.

Thank you,

Frances
